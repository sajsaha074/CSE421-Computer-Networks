# CSE421-Computer-Networks

CSE421 introduces students to the fundamental principles and practical aspects of computer networks. The course covers the layered architecture of network protocols, focusing on the OSI and TCP/IP models. Key topics include data transmission, error detection and correction, flow and congestion control, routing algorithms, switching techniques, IP addressing, and transport-layer protocols such as TCP and UDP.

The course also explores application-layer protocols like HTTP, DNS, FTP, and SMTP, and provides insights into network security, wireless and mobile networks, and the basics of network programming. Real-world networking tools, packet analysis (e.g., using Wireshark), and simulation tools may be used to reinforce learning.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

Understand and explain the layered structure of computer networks.

Analyze the functionality of various networking protocols across layers.

Design and configure basic IP-based networks.

Evaluate performance metrics and troubleshoot network issues.

Apply networking concepts in simulations and basic programming assignments.

Lab Component:
The accompanying lab (CSE421L) offers hands-on experience in network setup, configuration, simulation, and analysis to reinforce theoretical concepts learned in the lectures.
